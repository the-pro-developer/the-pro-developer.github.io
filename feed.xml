&lt;p&gt;This is the first post of the Pro Programmer Blog, hence the obligatory title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 10+ years of experience in the software development industry and today I thought I might start my own blog to write about my experiences in the industry, and here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt at blogging, the blog will definitely evolve during this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already decided on some topics to write about and will start writing it after I am done with fixing the blog’s layout, so wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>The Pro Developer</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">Hi there!
